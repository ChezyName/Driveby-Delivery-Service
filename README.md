# Driveby Delivery Service
Driveby Delivery Service is a 3D game where you go around giving people pizza's and if they don't give you your money. ***YOU KILL THEM!***
This project was for Ludem Dare 53, a bi-yearly gamejam where the goal is to make the best game possible with 72 hours given. This years theme was ***Delivery***.
That gave us the great idea of making a game where you sell pizza's and driveby people.

## Gameplay & How To Play
The gameplay loop is pretty simple. You always have a custermer to satisfy by giving them Pizza. Sometimes, custermers can **scam** you so you gotta deal with them like a good manager. *You put a bullet in thier brain.*
> Theres also frendlyfire... be carefull

Don't forget, you've got a truck full of pizza and you've got the keys. Drive around and give round pizzas but remember... **dont let them take advantage of you**
